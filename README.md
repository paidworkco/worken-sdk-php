## Install

Via Composer (tba.)

```
$ composer require paidworkco/worken-sdk
```

## Configuration

To ensure flexibility and ease of integration, the Worken SDK allows for configuration through environmental variables. These variables can be set directly in your project's .env file. Below is a list of available configuration variables along with their descriptions:

`WORKEN_POLYGONSCAN_APIKEY`: This is your API key, which you can generate at: https://polygonscan.com/myapikey. The API key is required for accessing PolygonScan's data programmatically and is essential for querying transaction history, block information data and other blockchain-related information on the Polygon network.

## Usage

#### Initialization
```php
use Worken\Worken;
$worken = new Worken(); // Create worken object
```
### Wallet
#### Get wallet balance
```php
$worken->wallet->getBalance(string $address)
```
| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `address` | `string` | **Required**. Your wallet address |

This structure details the balance of a wallet in terms of the WORK token specified in contract, providing the balance in WEI, Ether, and Hexadecimal units.

- `WEI (string)`: The balance of the wallet expressed in WEI, which is the smallest denomination of Ether. Given its size, the balance is represented as a string to maintain precision. Example: `11820000000000000000000`
- `Ether (string)`: The balance of the wallet converted into Ether, offering a more readable and commonly used representation of the balance. This conversion is necessary for understanding the balance in terms of Ether, which is more familiar to users. Example: `11820.000000000000000000`
- `Hex (string)`: The balance of the wallet expressed as a hexadecimal value. This format is often used in lower-level blockchain operations and interactions. Example: `0x0280c373aef4bd300000`

#### Get wallet information
```php
$worken->wallet->getInformation(string $address)
```
| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `address` | `string` | **Required**. Your wallet address |

- `nonce (int)`: Number of transactions on specific address, needed for send transaction.

*TO DO: more informations if needed*

#### Get wallet transaction history
```php
$worken->wallet->getHistory(string $address)
```
| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `address` | `string` | **Required**. Your wallet address |

Output given in array, below specific variables.

- `blockNumber`: Block number in which this transaction was included. Block numbers are sequential and indicate the position of a block in the blockchain.
- `timeStamp`: Timestamp for when the block was mined, expressed in Unix epoch time.
- `hash`: This is the unique identifier for the transaction, also known as the transaction hash(txHash).
- `from`: Address of the sender of the transaction.
- `to`: Recipient's address.
- `value`: This indicates the amount of cryptocurrency (likely Ether if this is Ethereum) that was transferred in this transaction. A value of "0" suggests that no Ether was transferred as part of this transaction, which is common for contract deployments like Worken(WORK) or other non-value transactions.
- `contractAddress`:  Address of the contract that was created by this transaction. 
- `input`: This field contains the data sent along with the transaction.
- `type`: This specifies the type of transaction. 
- `gas`: This is the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to use for this transaction. 
- `gasUsed`: This indicates the actual amount of gas that was used to execute the transaction. It's often less than the maximum gas specified.
- `traceId`: This is likely an identifier used to trace the transaction through the system or in a debugging process.
- `isError`: This field indicates whether the transaction encountered an error. A value of "0" means there was no error.
- `errCode`: Since `isError = 0`, this field is empty. If there was an error, it might contain an error code or message indicating what went wrong.

#### Create new wallet
```php
$worken->wallet->createWallet(int $words)
```
| Parameter | Type     | Description                                                                     |
